/**
 * Custom hooks that have been added to the GoDaddy version of WordPress core.
 * This allows us to see all our modifications easily in one place.
 * These hooks are added to WordPress from a patch file via @link https://github.com/gdcorp-partners/wordpress-patches.
 *
 * Constant (case) naming convention:
 *  - PascalCase.
 *  - Roughly match the name of the hook, but without the "godaddy" prefix.
 *  - Use underscores as a namespace separator
 *  - e.g. "FunctionName_HookName"
 *
 * Hook (value) naming convention:
 *  - Namespaced with slashes.
 *  - Always start with `godaddy` prefix, to help us identify custom hooks that we own that are not in normal WordPress.
 *  - Include the function or method name that the hook resides in.
 *  - Include the actual filter/action name last.
 *  - e.g. filter: "godaddy/{function name}/{thing being filtered}"
 *          "godaddy/prime_post_caches/posts" <-- the "posts" are what's being filtered
 *  - e.g. action: "godaddy/{function name}/{when the action triggers}"
 *          "godaddy/wp_insert_post/before_get_post_instance" <-- the action fires before a "get post instance" call
 *
 * Docblock convention:
 *  - First word should note if the hook is an "Action" or "Filter".
 *  - Briefly explain when the hook is executed and how it benefits us.
 *  - Cross-reference the function or method where the hook is fired.
